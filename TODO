GNU Queue load balancing and batch processing system TODO list.

Here is a list of things to do, in no especial order.

If you have suggestions, write to <wkrebs@gnu.org>

Up-to-the-minute development information is linked from GNU Queue's
Homepage, http://www.gnuqueue.org


0. Move GNU Queue closer to draft protocol:

    Move query and wakeup onto the same port.
    Possibly replace TCP/IP with TLS using weak 40-bin RC4 "international"
     encryption that no governments have ever objected to, or maybe just
     TLS negotiation with plaintext.
    Replace fwrite and fread with macro that do network byte ordering
      (without this, it will only meet the draft protocol on big endian
machines)
    Add support for VERSION0 job control file (change wakeup.c, handle.c,
      queued.c, and queue.c); this is really for jobs submitted from
      non-unix platforms. Currently, we only support VERSION1 jobs.

1. Improve MPI and add PVM hooks.

2. Eliminate need for no_root_squash (GNU/Linux) when the server is running
   under root privilege, perhaps by sending
   the binary process info files to the server via TCP/IP
   rather than using the file system to communicate the info.

3. Hooks for AFS and/or Kerberos.

4. More sophisticated load-balancing scheme to deal with very large networks.
