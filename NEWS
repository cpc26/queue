*Feb 5, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.12

	Added check to ReadHosts to make sure that HostFile define was properly
	configured.

	Added MAXHOSTNAMELEN to queue.h on platforms where it is not defined.

	Fixed problem with h_aliases/h_name in canonicalname that was pointed
	out by and patched by a large number of people. The new code
	now counts the number of dots in hostname, h_name, and h_aliases
	and returns the first in that order with the most dots in it.

	Changed address lookup code so that it always vets h_name through
	canonicalhost.

	Eliminated a number of compiler warnings in queued.c by changing
	functions to static. Also, if name lookup fails on incoming socket, 
	string is set to "unresolved" rather than bogus IP addr pointer,
	which eliminated another warning. Compiler warnings proved themselves
	harmless in past versions, but distracted a few users trying to
	track down real bugs on their platform.

*January 28, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.11 patchlevel 6 Jan 1999

	Made change to queued
	suggested by Arthur Castonguay <arthurc@cadabratech.com> to prevent
	segv on some platforms when looking at null onlyhost string.

*January 27, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.11 patchlevel 5 Jan 1999

	Fixed the implementation of the error mail shutdown so that
	it actually shuts down the error mail. :)

*January 27, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.11 patchlevel 4 1999

	Added autoconf code to autodetect solaris

	Added counter to error mail; shuts down system error email after 
	more than 10 error messages go out. Someone might want to modify
	this so that the counter is reset after 24 hours have elapsed.

*January 26, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.11 patchlevel 3 1999

	Added sigblock.c and made sys_siglist always static when undeclared
	in the never ending effort to support all versions of Solaris.

	Got rid of varargs.h as it hasn't been used in some time.

*January 25, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

        Version 1.11 patchlevel 2 1999

	Added FreeBSD support by placing sys/time.h at top of define.h and
	defining XCASE and IUCLC as zero on platforms where the includes
	don't define them.

	Added check for missing command line parameters in Queue.

	Changed error to warning if hostname in qhostsfile fails to
	resolve in qlib.c
	
	Fixed bug in sigsetmask in queue.h
