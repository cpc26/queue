*November 1, 2000    W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Released 1.30.1
	
	Changed ./configure options for queue_manager to be 
	"--enable-manager=YES" and "--enable-manager=NO", with NO
	being the default. This is because some users reported problems
	with queue_manager, and I wanted to be able to release 1.30 as
	a more stable version with a RedHat 7.0 fix rather than as an
	alpha development version with queue_manager compiled in. By
	changing the default to using the old code, I need only make
	one release to solve the RedHat 7.0 problem.
		
*October 31, 2000    W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Impelemented bugfix to allocline in queued.c
	inspire from bugfix code submitted by "Arthur H. Britto II" <ahbritto@iat.com>. This is needed to fix RedHat 7.0
	
*October 22, 2000    W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Upon receiving word from Monica Lau <mllau@alantro.com> that Texas Instruments
	wanted to release the queue_manager package under its own copyright as a GPL'd
	program and receiving the C++ code with a Texas Instrument copyright header
	(to speed up the legal processes --- Monica's code is now released
	under the Texas Instruments copyright; Texas Instruments can keep it this way
	or can reassign these portions at a separate date.) I integrated the Queue_Manager
	package into GNU Queue as follows:

	- Added the "--enable-nomanager" switch to ./configure.in and ./configure so that Queue_manager can be compiled
	in or out at will. (Added junk main() to .cc files when queue_manager is to be compiled out;
	this is a hack and will still require a pseudo-working c++ program, or at least echo
	symlinked to c++ for the ./configure and compile to run successfully, even when
	queue_manager and the .cc code isn't wanted. Any ideas how to eliminate this hack so that
	Queue can be compiled without the queue_manager package and without C++ would be appreciated.)

	Compilation of queue_manager might not be the default option in the first few releases, so
	the nomanager option might change to "manager" option.

	- Added the GNU Queue URL to the .cc files contributed by Monica.

	- Using diff, carefully examined the changes Monica made to queue.c and queued.c. Most of these were indicated
	by comments, but a few weren't.

	Added a header ("2000/10/22 coded added by Monica Lau <mllau@alantro.com") and a trailer to each of these
	pieces of code, along with the #ifdef QUEUE_MANAGER switch, so that these can be compiled in and out using ./configure.

	Code 8 lines or longer in queue.c and queued.c became (C) 2000 Texas Instruments, and these have been clearly indicated in
	the code per FSF/GNU policy to make the copyright ownership of these parts of queue.c and queued.c clear in case these is ever a question about these.
	(Chunks of code less than 8 lines are thought to retain the copyright ownership of the original work.)

	For legal reasons, it is very important that a clear distinction is made in the source code as to what is copyright Texas Instruments
	and what is copyrighted by other entities; this has been carefully done.

	In some cases, it was necessary to add an #else to go back to the old code. Usually, this involved compiling in the older option
	switch statements and usage lines when the queue_manager package wasn't being used.

	-Modified configure.in and ./configure for C++ support; which means ./configure will fail if it doesn't find a C++ compiler. See above
	for why this is bad.

	-Created the doc/queue_manager directory to house the docs Monica contributed on queue_manager, at least temporarily.

	Moved all of Monica's "diagrams" together in Star Office into a single StarOffice slide show, queue_manager_slides.sda.
	Added the GNU Queue URL along with Monica's name, email, and a Texas Instruments Copyright Statement to these slides

	Exported the StarOffice slides to HTML and EPS as queue_manager_slides_html.tar.gz (folder in tar.gz format because of CVS concerns with so many temporary files) 
	and queue_manager_slides.eps for users who don't have StarOffice (the majority.)

	Added a Texas Instruments copyright statement and GPL release notice to the StarOffice documentation file she provided, exported
	this to HTML and UNIX text formats as well (queue_manager_docs.htm and queue_manager_docs.txt .)
	

*September 9, 2000   W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Released version 1.20.2.

*September 9, 2000   W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	During pre-release testing, found it
	necessary to strike 'x=' from
	'x=netfread(&load, sizeof(load), 1, argh);'
	in line 324; this causes a compilation failure. After
	this seemed to work normally.
		
*August 14, 2000      Eric Deal <erci.deal@conexant.com>

	Made changes for cross-platform interoperability to move Queue
	closer into compliance with draft protocol to move towards
 	hetergeneous operation (e.g., Solaris<->Linux). 
	Added netfwrite/netfread functions to read/write binary data in
 	network byte order. Replaced calls to fwrite/fread with
 	netfwrite/netfread.

        The relevant changes are in the following files:

	   queue.h        (included queue_endian.h)
	   queue_endian.h (new file)
	   sha1.c         (included queue_endian.h)
	   queue.c        (netfread/netfwrite)
	   queued.c       (netfread/netfwrite)
	   wakeup.c       (netfread/netfwrite)
	   handle.c       (netfread/netfwrite)
	   qlib.c         (added netfread/netfwrite functions)

	
*August 11, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	In Makefile.am :

	"rdiego@iol.it"<rdiego@iol.it> pointed out that random must be
	installed by Makefile.am (rather than in install-local-stuff)
	because it needs to link gethostbyname under Solaris. So, it
	was registered with automake as a noinst program. See Makefile.am
	
	
*August 11, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Eric Deal <eric.deal@conexant.com> pointed out strange commentation
	are setrlimit source in handle.c that affected the socket setup.

	This deed indeed look strange. In fact, it probably caused a new bug
	in the handling of X-windows applications (which close stdin and
	stdout) that I know wasn't present in old versions of Queue.

	So, I've fixed handle.c to just comment out the setrlimit code. This
	may also have been commented out because of Solaris. If so, it
	should be put back in with an "#ifndef solaris" instead of a comment.

*August 11, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Two bugs:

	1.

	Bug spotted by eht@sourceforge.net.
	QueueD could deadlock if both are trying to transmit at same time to
	each other. So, always fork by setting TRANSMIT_DEBUG in queued.c

	2.
		
	Eric Deal <eric.deal@conexant.com> pointed out that 1260-1264 in
	queued.c causes a hang Solaris, so I added an "ifndef solaris" to this
	section of the code to prevent it from being compiled into Solaris.

	
*August 11, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Made some changes to pty.c for linux. #ifdef linux causes
	utmp to be processed slightly differently under linux. Also,
	added check to make sure /dev/tty doesn't get chmod'ded on
	all platforms.
	
*July 30, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	1.20.1 released.

*July 30, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Finally added code to get queued to send out jobs that are sitting
	around. If this works well, this would make it a release.

*July 29, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

        Added SHA1-based bi-directional digest authentication scheme to
	bring Queue closer to draft protocol. The authentication scheme
	authenticates the cluster-wide password (cookiefile) in wakeup.c
	and queued.c without transmitting it over the network, improving
	security for NOROOT users. (Persons on the cluster can no
	longer submit jobs by spying the cookiefile password.)

	Added same mechanism to queue.c and handle.c to allow these two
	programs to authenticate to each other that they know the contents
	of the cookie in the job control file without actually sending this
	over the network or admiting what it is to each other.
 	This assumes, of course, some sort of secure protocol is in place
	for transmission of the jobcontrolfile in the first place, such as
	TLS. As TLS also allows authentication by different methods, this
	additional authentication may be superflous, but at the moment it
	seems necessary.
	
*July 25, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Changed URL in docs to new http://www.gnuqueue.org top-level
	domain.

*July 20, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Bug fix by Stephen Jazdzewski <Stephen@Geocast.Net>;
	check for Null first before doing comparison to avoid segfault
	in anonmolous /etc/hosts DNS situation around line 460 in queued.c

*July 19, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Added "JOBCONTROLFILE\nVERSION0\nVERSION1\n" string to job control
	file transfer protocol to
	comply with draft protocol.
	
	Added "QUERY\nVERSION0\nVERSION1\n" string to query protocol to
	comply with draft protocol.

	Added version control string to job control file to comply more
	closely with draft protocol.

	Decided instead to use SHA1 from GNU Privacy Guard as the secure
	hash function used to authenticate queued.c to queue.c. Note that
	GNU Queue does not use encryption --- the hash function is
	merely used for authentication purposes. Everything else is
	still in the clear. The draft protocol calls for the use of
	TLS sockets, probably with weak RC4 40 bit "international"
 	security that no governments have ever objected to. So far,
	everything is still plaintext and no ciphers are included
	with the code.

*July 18, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

        MD5 is a much faster and much better hash function for our
	purposes than crypt(), so we eliminate the performance hit 
	we were previously taking by using md5 as our hash function.
	
	Added md5.c, md5.h, md5global.h, and md5test.c from RFC 1321.
	Added a wrapper function, md5() to qlib.c that calls md5 in
	md5.c.
	
	Changed handle.c and queue.c to define the one-way function
	macro ONEWAY as the md5 routine in qlib.c

*July 18, 2000      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Applied Dan's fix from 1.12.9 (see below) to 1.20-pre queued.c
	development code.

	Applied setsockopt patch to queue.c (changes type of optionlength from
	int* to int; this produced a compiler warning previously, but appeared
	to work.)

	Applied HP-UX compile-time patch to queued.c

	Replaced references to Yale email address with more permanent 
	GNU address as I hope to eventually graduate from Yale and don't
	want emails to bounce when this happens. This was done in a number of
	files. I also changed the web address to point to queue.sourceforge.net

*May 17, 2000       W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	1.12.9 rolled out.

	As suggested by Dan Nicolaescu <dann@ics.uic.edu>, removed OS-dependent load-average
	code in getloadf() in queued.c. Instead, changed queued.c to obtain load averages
	using getloadavg.c from GNU Emacs distribution, which now handles the OS-dependent work.

	This should fix the problem Solaris users were having with GNU Queue.

	Updated the documentation (README, Install, and pages in doc) to reflect GNU Queue's status
	as a member of SourceForge. Changed unofficial homepage to http://queue.sourceforge.net, and
	changed information on mailing list subscription.
	
*May 17, 2000        W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>
	
	Dan Nicolaescu <dann@ics.uic.edu> indented a number of files.

*Apr 19, 1999        W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	As pointed out by Peter Marquardt, the case LOADSTOP was accidentally
	removed from the development code around line 1598, silently
	disabling this feature. This change adds it back in again.

*Mar 13, 1999        W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Fixed -h/-H option problem in the way queue called con_daemon.

	Also fixed reserve port problems in root environment: wakeup
	wasn't properly reserving reserved ports, and queued wasn't exiting
	gracefully when it found this. Thanks to Joey Hess for pointing out
	these problems.

*Mar 13, 1999        W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	1.20.1-pre3
	
	Many changes:

	Merged beta checkpointing code into 1.12.8. Added --enable-checkpoint
	option to ensure that most of the beta code doesn't normally get
	compiled in unless the user actually wants this.

	Radically changed protocol. Eliminated NFS; there is no longer any
	need for a root-writable (or user-writable) shared NFS directory.
	
	Each queued now
	has its own, local spool directory stored in localstatedir (var/queue
	by default). Queries on wakeupport are answered, and if first byte
	is -1 following, cfile follows which is stored in the spool directory.
	Cookie is null if root installation (in which case wakeup connection
	had better come from a privileged port), otherwise cookiefile
	together with remotehost IP authenticate user. Cookiefile is usually
	in share/queuecookiefile. If not present, it is installized
	(using random.c) to a random value at install time. It must be present
	and indentical on all hosts in the NO_ROOT environment to allow the
	queue program to authenticate itself to queued. (NO_ROOT users are
	also encouraged to run identd for additional security.)

	If -2 follows cookie, migrator mfile is accepted. First #of bytes
	in migrating file, followed by mfile, followed by cfile.

	Changed con_daemon(), wakeup(), queue.c, and queued.c to support these
	changes.

	Also added systemflag variable to shut down SIGCHLD process table
	complaints of Solaris users running the uptime() code. systemflag=1
	causes SIGCHLD handler to ignore processes not in its table.
	
*Mar 13, 1999        W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	1.12.8 rolled out.

	Went back to old telnet/grep identd test in configure.in because
	netstat is not available to unprivileged users on some platforms.

*Mar 11, 1999        W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Changed all references to status to wait_status in waitforchild() to
	fix HP-UX compile problem.
	
*Mar 9, 1999        W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Added support for _getpty call. This should fix pty support on
	IRIX.
	
*Mar 9, 1999        W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Fixed an oversight by me in applying/modifying
 	Matthais' patches earlier. j->j_onlyhost was not strdup'd. It is
	now.
	
*Mar 7, 1999        W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	1.12.7 rolled out.

	Boosted max number of environmental variables in handle.c to 1000;
	sooner or later, this will need to be replaced with a dynamic limit.

	Using latest versions of autoconf (1.13) and automake (1.4) to generate 
	configure and Makefile.in

*Mar 7, 1999	       W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	1.20.1-pre2 rolled out

	Modified wakeup() to support migration. Added wakeup.o to things
	compiled into queueD.

	Added code and commented-out calls to actually do migration.

	(Currently, everything is set up for testing since there are still
	bugs to be worked out in the kernel API and elsewhere that we will
	need people to test out.)
	
*Mar 6, 1999	       W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	1.20.1-pre1 rolled out

	Added early development support for two types of checkpoint migration.

	Added mrestart.c and checkpoint.h
	code to distribution to support kernel checkpoint mode.

	Increase EMAX the maximum number of environment variables to 1000.
	(This limit will have to be eliminated at some point.)
	
*Mar 4, 1999	    Matthias Urlichs <smurf@noris.de>

        Applied large patch submitted Mar 3 1999 to queue-tips (with some
	small changes by WGK for platform portability and copyright purposes.)

	Changes: 

	- various misc bugs
	- fixed lex.l to work with flex
	- ignores locking on filesystems with no locking implemented
	- optimized calls to getdtablesize in queued.c
	- (WGK) added /usr/sbin/sendmail execs, which is where some newer
	distributions put it
	- SO_REUSRADDR in queued.c to allow queued to be started within
	2 min of killing
	- rearranged some autoconf lines

	See queue tips archive for details.
	
*Mar 4, 1999        W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

        Added added S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR to line 579 in queue.c based on 
	suggestion from zblazek@engr.UVic.C; this will allow Queue to 
	create files even if the user has bogus umask.

	Fixed minor problem with default usage message in queued.

*Mar 3, 1999	    W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Rolled out 1.12.6.
	
*Mar 2, 1999	    W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Initialized maxdots to -1 in canonicalhost rather than to zero to
	prevent it from returning NULL.

*Feb 28, 1999	    W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Rolled out patchlevel 5 from Peter's Feb 26 patch, which is
	now numbered 1.12.5 rather than 1.12.p5.

	There is no patchlevel 4; this was skipped to avoid confusion
	with the way outside archives are numbering these files. RPMs
	start with release 1, so patchlevel 3 became release 4, whereas
	other archivists have adopted the convention that the patchlevel
	is a dot behind the minor version, e.g., 1.12.5 is patchlevel 5.
	In the future, we will number from patchlevel 1 to avoid confusion.
	
*Feb 26, 1999       Peter Marquardt <wwwutz@mpimg-berlin-dahlem.mpg.de>

	Applied small patch for qlib.c, which tended to crash
	in canonicalhost() in some rare circumstances...
	(no dots in any entry of hostent).
	
*Feb 19, 1999       W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	patchlevel 3

	Removed all remaining calls to localhost. myhostname() now returns canonicalhost. This means pid files will be fully qualified.

	Added test for Digital to configure.in. This sets BROKEN_TERMIOS_VMIN on this platform.

*Feb 15, 1999       Kevin Jacobs <jacobs@darwin.EPBI.CWRU.Edu>

	Added VMIN fix for BROKEN_TERMIOS_VMIN to fix pty support on some versions of Digital.

	Removed a number of calls to localhost() which were causing problems.

	Made hostname comparisons case-insensitive.

*Feb 13, 1999       W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	patch 2
	
	Fixed PATH bug  and assorted command searching
	bugs in queued.c; PATH searched is now that of remote env.

	Added code to convert myhostname() and canonicalhost() names to
	lowercase for comparison.

	Added code to validhost to make copy of hostname for platforms
	with _very_ unstable gethostbyname static areas before ReadHosts()
	is called.

	Changed canonicalhost to allow returns of unqualified domainnames
	on hosts with very lazy gethostbynames().

*Feb 6, 1999    W. G. Krebs  <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	patch 1

	problem in changedots that accidentally made it into the released code.

*Feb 5, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.12

	Added check to ReadHosts to make sure that HostFile define was properly
	configured.

	Added MAXHOSTNAMELEN to queue.h on platforms where it is not defined.

	Fixed problem with h_aliases/h_name in canonicalname that was pointed
	out by and patched by a large number of people. The new code
	now counts the number of dots in hostname, h_name, and h_aliases
	and returns the first in that order with the most dots in it.

	Changed address lookup code so that it always vets h_name through
	canonicalhost.

	Eliminated a number of compiler warnings in queued.c by changing
	functions to static. Also, if name lookup fails on incoming socket, 
	string is set to "unresolved" rather than bogus IP addr pointer,
	which eliminated another warning. Compiler warnings proved themselves
	harmless in past versions, but distracted a few users trying to
	track down real bugs on their platform.

*January 28, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.11 patchlevel 6 Jan 1999

	Made change to queued
	suggested by Arthur Castonguay <arthurc@cadabratech.com> to prevent
	segv on some platforms when looking at null onlyhost string.

*January 27, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.11 patchlevel 5 Jan 1999

	Fixed the implementation of the error mail shutdown so that
	it actually shuts down the error mail. :)

*January 27, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.11 patchlevel 4 1999

	Added autoconf code to autodetect solaris

	Added counter to error mail; shuts down system error email after 
	more than 10 error messages go out. Someone might want to modify
	this so that the counter is reset after 24 hours have elapsed.

*January 26, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.11 patchlevel 3 1999

	Added sigblock.c and made sys_siglist always static when undeclared
	in the never ending effort to support all versions of Solaris.

	Got rid of varargs.h as it hasn't been used in some time.

*January 25, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

        Version 1.11 patchlevel 2 1999

	Added FreeBSD support by placing sys/time.h at top of define.h and
	defining XCASE and IUCLC as zero on platforms where the includes
	don't define them.

	Added check for missing command line parameters in Queue.

	Changed error to warning if hostname in qhostsfile fails to
	resolve in qlib.c
	
	Fixed bug in sigsetmask in queue.h

*January 22, 1999 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.11 Jan 1999

	Modified apparent load average to compute expected load average
	AFTER job starts. New formula is:

	load = (avg[0] + 1.0)/((max(0, qp->q_vmaxexec - qp->q_nexec)+1)*qp->q_pfactor);

	Old formula was:
  
       load = avg[0]/((max(0, qp->q_vmaxexec - qp->q_nexec)+1)*qp->q_pfactor);

	We can think of the effective load average as being the inverse of
	the computing power of the loaded machine AFTER the next CPU
	guzzling job starts, i.e., 1/ (MIPS/(jobs)), where jobs = load + 1.
	The old formula computed 1/(MIPS/(jobs - 1)). In an unloaded
	cluster (load == 0), pfactor (MIPS) would not be taken into 
	consideration. The new formula remedies this, sending the
	job to the fastest machine (highest pfactor) if all machines
	are unloaded.

	Added sigsetmask.c as REPLACE_FUNC for SunOS.
	Added defines to queue.h and changes to configure.in for SunOS.
	Merged getopt.c and getopt1.c and renamed getopt_long.c, added
	to configure.in as REPLACE_FUNC so they won't get compiled in
	when not needed. -lbsd should no longer be necessary for SunOS
	(although it is still in configure.in).

	Replaced _cleanup() with fflush(NULL) as suggested by
	Nick Burrett  <nick.burrett@btinternet.com>.

	Fixed the NO_ROOT hack on non-GNU/Linux machines (really
	on machines without /proc; have to detect this in ./configure
	someday....) that calls uptime and scanfs the load-averages in.

*Mon Jan 18 16:27:31 1999  Nick Burrett  <nick.burrett@btinternet.com>

	* queued.c (waitforchild): Change wait status union type to int.
	Cast status to void* for calls to `wait3'. 

*January 14, 1999	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.10 patchlevel 3 Jan 1999

	Added rlimits for Alpha platform.


*January 14, 1999	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.10 patchelevel 2 Jan 1999

	Missing strdup in queued.c code caused hostname weirdness on
	the Digital Alpha platform.
	
*January 13, 1999	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.10 patchlevel 1 Jan 1999

	Misplaced bracket in qlib was causing a malloc error on some systems.

*January 13, 1999	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>
	
	Version 1.10 Jan 1999

	Primarily, compilation and Makefile 
	patches for Digital Alpha Unix OSF/1; thanks
	to Piergiorgio Alotto <alotto@die.unige.it> for providing an
	account on his Alpha for the port.
	
	Added missing getopt1.c code that would have prevented
	compilated on platforms missing getopt_long in their libc.

	Changed configure.in and other files to support global package
	VERSION variable.

	"--version" outputs version if QHOSTSFILE fails to exist.

	Also includes a minor IRIX compilation fix.

	Queue load balancing and batch processing system

	Also, redid ChangeLog format.

	Added FAQ-O-MATIC documentation system to Web page; add your own
	documentation to the system!

	Minor manual corrections

*January 2, 1999     	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>
	
	Version 1.099p2

	Fix to queued.c to send output of batched jobs properly. Bug spotted
	by Carlo Strozzi <carlos@linux.it>.

	Fix to queued.c to allow sendmail to work with NO_ROOT (paranoid
	sendmails ignored outgoing mail with NO_ROOT.)

	Fix to configure.in to include -crypt on some platforms.

	Fix to queue.c to allow crypt() to compile properly with ONE_WAY.

*January 1, 1998        Carlo Strozzi <carlos@linux.it>.

	Makefile bugfix (didn't add name of local machine to qhostsfile 
	correctly; also problem with install-info. Bug fix courtesy of 
	Carlo Strozzi.)

*December 29, 1998      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 1.099p1

	Deleted braces in configure script which were causing problems
	on non-Linux systems.

*December 28, 1998      W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>
 
	Version 1.099, December 1998

	Added code to read host ACL from file courtesy of Dave van Leeuwen.

	Blinking-lights automatic installation.

	Improved documentation. Added texinfo manual. We now have a 30+
	page comprehensive manual for GNU Queue!

	Added "--enable-root" option to ./configure script; this option
	must be used for root, cluster-wise install (formerly the default
	and still the preferred option). Since non-administrators are
	presumably less sophisticated, the default was changed
	to install for these users.

	Numerous bugfixes.

	Name changed to GNU Queue to reflect adoption by the FSF GNU project.

	Added GNU-style long-options support to the executables
	(e.g., "queue --version" is supported.)

	Renamed batchd.c to queued.c; old queued.c now called handle.c;
	is linked into new queued.c for efficiency. [The only reason for
	running handle() as a separate executable was to allow a debugger
	to trace handle(); debuggers normally can't follow a program after
 	a fork.]

	HP-UX 10 compile fixes.

	Added "qsh" syntax to allow for backward compatibility with systems
	than expect an rsh/remsh-type command. '+' is wild-card host,
	meaning allow Queue to pick where to run the command.

	"qsh" is first stage of MPI support; so noted in documentation.

	Realized that there could be port confusion if a queue is killed
	and a new queue subsequent uses the same port; added cookie
	passing to solve this problem. With NO_ROOT, privileged ports
	aren't available, so cookies also stop malicious users on the
	same cluster from spoofing queue.

	Added one-way trap function crypt() to allow queued to 
	authenticate itself to queue when running NO_ROOT without
	privileged ports. If privileged ports are availabe
	(NO_ROOT is undefined) or verifiable ports are available
	(HAVE_IDENTD is defined; see below) crypt() is replaced
 	with a do-nothing function to eliminate the performance hit.
	Cookies are still used in the other direction to prevent
	port confusion.
		
	NO_ROOT install can't use privileged ports, so added identd support
	with HAVE_IDENTD option to prevent queued (and queue) spoofing from
	within the cluster in cases where the cookies aren't
	good enough; see manual.

	Added "onlyhost" field to binary exchange file; modified batchd.c,
	queue.c, and queued.c accordingly. Added prefhost and onlyhost
	options to queue.c . This is necessary to fully support qsh
	command syntax, needed for MPI support.

	Changed defaults for "queue" to full-pty, wait around, immediate
	execution. "qsh" defaults to no-pty, wait around, immediate
	execution.

	Added "-H hostname" option to by-pass "onlyhost" field; -H makes
	hostname the preferred host, but jobs will be sent elsewhere if
	hostname is down. "-h hostname" now only allows execution on
	"hostname". This was necessary for MPI support with "qsh."
	
        Disabled the "feature" that required queued (formerly batchd)
 	to be started with a full pathname. This means the 
	"restart signal" won't work (unless you actually _have_ 
	started queued with a full pathname),
	but it makes starting queued more intuitive. To restart, you
	just SIGTERM and run again now. (Or, invoke with full pathname
	and send the traditional re-start sigal.)


* November 26, 1998 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>
	
	Version 0.23b Patchlevel 5, November 1998

	Added NO_ROOT compile option to allow use of some Queue features
	without root privileges. (Everything must be installed and run
	as the same UID.)

* November 26, 1998 	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 0.23b Patchlevel 4, November 1998

	Solaris compilation fixes.

* November 25, 1998	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 0.23b Patchlevel 3, November 1998

	Minor HP-UX conflict fixes.
	Fixed HP-UX dirent.h / ndir.h conflict in define.h

* November 19, 1998	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 0.23b Patchlevel 2, November 1998

		Also, made changes to make it compatible with GNU/Linux SuSE 5.0 with kernel 2.0.35 :

	renamed struct qelem to qelem_queue,
	
	also implemented sa_mask changes using long int pointer cast as this seems the most portable solution.

* November 19, 1998    Dave van Leeuwen <dave@elec.canterbury.ac.nz>

	Bugfix courtesy of Dave van Leeuwen <dave@elec.canterbury.ac.nz>

	Modifications:
	*  line 35 of queue.h, changed extern char **host; to extern char *host[]; as
	   gcc 2.7.2.3 on linux would not find any host other than the first one.
	*  line 742 in queued.c changed
	      if(*command[0] == '/') strcpy(file,command[0]); to
	      if((*command[0] == '/') || (*command[0] == '.'))  strcpy(file,command[0]);
	    to run relative commands (ie ./x, ../../bin/x etc)

* November 7, 1998	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 0.23b Patchlevel 1, November 1998

	Commented out free() in localhost() in batchd.c

* August 27, 1998	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 0.23b, August, 1998

	Added GNU autoconf and automake support; re-wrote header files and
	#ifdefs to take advantage of autoconf's capabilities; as a result
	the code is now much more portable and ports readily to a large number
	of platforms. 

	Added SGI IRIX support as a result. Tested platforms now include
	GNU/Linux, HP-UX, SunOS 5.6, Solaris, and IRIX.

	Eliminated the va_dcl stuff in queue.c as it is a portability nightmare
	and not really necessary, various other minor changes to source.

	Updated documentation to reflect autoconf and other changes.

	Updated TODO list to reflect preferences of users on mailing list.


* August 20, 1998	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 0.22b August, 1998

	Upgraded to beta after large numbers of downloads without bug reports
	(I know there are bugs left. :-) But, the code is obviously usable. )

	Fixed Makefile install bugs :-) Added uninstall option.

	Increased SLEEPTIME to 120 to work better on larger clusters.

	Added setuid() in queue to correspond to principle of least privilege;
	also allows users to send queue signals via KILL instead of just via
	the keyboard (I.e., this was a bugfix) :-)

	Added Solaris support courtesy of Igor Schein.

	Minor changes to documentation.

	Announced queue-tips list (write to 
	queue-tips-request@bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu to join.)

* August 18, 1998	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 0.21a August, 1998

	Queue was ported to Linux with minor modifications to support this new
	environment and released in alpha version to the general public under a
	GPL agreement.

* Circa 1995	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 0.20a Circa 1995

	In response to user requests for better control of batch capabilities,
	queue was merged with the apparently non-copyrighted,
	'freely-redistributable' batch suite of Alex White 'and many others.'
	Specifically, code from batchd now monitored multiple directory
	queues, imposing limits (such as load average requirements, maximum
	number of jobs in each queue, priorities, etc) on jobs run in batch
	processing mode. Batchd was modified to accept jobs from queue and
	spawn jobs via a modified queued rather than directly. In addition, a
	command was added to support the new mutliple-host environment and
	allow conditions (such as load average restrictions, maximum number of
	jobs) to specified different for different hosts in the cluster from
	the same configuration file.

* Circa 1994	W. G. Krebs <wkrebs@gnu.org>

	Version 0.10a Circa 1994

	In-house alpha version original designed as a simple replacement to
	rsh for a homogeneous cluster of HP-UX hosts in order to do load
	balancing over the network. The stub mechanism and pty mechanisms,
	allowing users to background and foreground remote jobs by
	backgrounding and foregrounding the daemon/stub, was already firmly in
	place in this version. Queue placed files into a single directory,
	which was then monitored and run by the queued.
